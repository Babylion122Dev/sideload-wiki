<Note>
  You should already have a signing app installed, Please go to our other guides and install one if you haven't already.
</Note>

<Warning>
    It is highly recommended you have a device with an A16 chip or higher. If you don't know what chip your device has, refer to appleDB.
    It is crucial to have a processor fast enough to handle intensive emulation like Nintendo Switch, as otherwise you may experince jarring slowdowns.
</Warning>

## Download the MeloNX .ipa

Download the latest release of MeloNX from the releases page on their Git below.&#x20;

```

## Install using Feather

<Warning>
You must have your Debug Certificate imported into Feather! If not, you will be unable to enable JIT.

Import that app in the library section by tapping import, and then tapping on the file in your recent files.

After importing it should appear in your library as normal.

Tap on the app, tap sign, and then after it completes signing, tap on it again, and tap install.

After installing you should see MeloNX on your home screen!

BUT WAIT. You still need a method of enabling JIT! For this guide we will be setting up StikJIT.

## Setting up StikJIT

StikJIT is an app that allows you to enable JIT without even needing a seperate server or PC to connect to first.

To use StikJIT you will need the following:

Access to a Windows PC or Mac (This is only needed for SETUP, and will not be needed after)

StosVPN from the iOS AppStore, which you can find [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051)
