  You should already have a signing app installed, whether it be Feather or eSign. Please go to our other guides and install one if you haven't already.

<Warning>
    It is highly recommended you have a device with an A16 chip or higher. If you don't know what chip your device has, refer to appleDB.
    It is crucial to have a processor fast enough to handle intensive emulation like Nintendo Switch, as otherwise you may experince jarring slowdowns.
